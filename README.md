# SQL Project README

## Overview
This SQL project includes queries designed to extract specific insights from datasets available in Mode Analytics. Each query targets a particular question and utilizes the appropriate tables to derive meaningful results.

## Questions

### Question #1
Using `tutorial.crunchbase_investments` and `tutorial.crunchbase_companies`, write a query that shows a company's name, "status" (found in the Companies table), and the number of unique investors in that company. Order by the number of investors from most to fewest. Limit to only companies in the state of New York.

### Question #2
HARD QUESTION (HINT: google nested queries / subqueries to find the answer). Skip if you can’t do it.
Using `tutorial.crunchbase_acquisitions` and `tutorial.crunchbase_companies`, find what were the top 10 years to found a company if you wanted acquirers from New York to buy your company without joining tables.

### Question #3
Write a query that joins `benn.college_football_players` and `benn.college_football_teams` to then display player names, school names, and conferences for schools in the "FBS (Division I-A Teams)" division.

### Question #4
Let’s go back into The Office. Check the `tutorial.dunder_mifflin_paper_sales` table. Now that you know the GROUP BY clause, write a query for the performance numbers of all account managers. Using a comment block argue a case on who’s the best and who’s the worst performing one based on attributes of your own choosing.

## Conclusion
These SQL queries offer insights into various aspects of the provided datasets. For further exploration or analysis, additional queries or modifications can be made as needed.
